# conman

Luminus database connection management and SQL query generation library

The library provides pooled connections using the [clj-dbcp](https://github.com/kumarshantanu/clj-dbcp) library.

The queries are generated using [Yesql](https://github.com/krisajenkins/yesql/tree/devel) and wrapped with
connection aware functions.

## Usage

The queries are bound to the connection using the `bind-queries` function. The function
accepts the connection atom followed one or more strings represting SQL query files.

```clojure
(use 'conman.core)

(defonce ^:dynamic conn (atom nil))

(conman/bind-connection conn "sql/queries.sql")
```

Next, the `connect!` function should be called to initialize the database connection.
The function accepts an atom to store the connection followed a map with the database
specification.

```clojure
(def pool-spec
  {:adapter    :postgresql
   :jdbc-url   "jdbc:postgresql://localhost/myapp?user=user&password=pass"
   :init-size  1
   :min-idle   1
   :max-idle   4
   :max-active 32})

(connect! conn pool-spec)
```

The connection can be terminated by running the `disconnect!` funciton:

```clojure
(disconnect! conn)
```

When using a dynamic connection atom it's possible to use the `with-transaction`
macro to rebind it to the transaction connection. The SQL query functions
generated by the `bind-queries` functon will automatically use the transaction
connection in that case:

```clojure
(with-transaction [t-conn conn]
  (jdbc/db-set-rollback-only! t-conn)
  (create-user!
    {:id         "foo"
     :first_name "Sam"
     :last_name  "Smith"
     :email      "sam.smith@example.com"})
  (get-user {:id "foo"}))
```
